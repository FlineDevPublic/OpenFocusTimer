# OpenFocusTimer

Pomodoro timer with categories, reflection, history & statistics. Developed fully in the open while [streaming live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/Jeehut), full recordings available [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvkAveYAfY4TVdM3Lc52SJTkuGB85I5uw).

## About

You can find a description of this projects features [here](https://www.notion.so/flinedev-public/Open-Focus-Timer-59d9331cd3c84c13be7aa38beb6bc277).

## Getting Started

This project is modularized into many small Swift packages using Point-Free's [modularization approach](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep171-modularization-part-1). To work on it, open the `OpenFocusTimer/OpenFocusTimer.xcodeproj` file (not the `Package.swift` file at the root). Choose the scheme `iOSApp` or `macOSApp` to run the full app.

The advantage of the modularization is that you can also choose any of the other targets such as `TimerFeature` to only build a smaller package for faster build times when working only on that part of the project.

This app applies Point-Free's [The Composable Architecture (TCA)](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture). For TCA newcomers, it consists of a `View` with a related `State` struct and `Action` enum which are combined in the so called `Store` object. All navigation, state updating and side-effects logic is put into a `Reducer`, which has access to an `Environment` to make the whole feature easily testable.
